# Bowling Kata

This repository contains a student project created for an ongoing lecture on object-oriented programming with Java at HWR Berlin (summer term 2022).

## Abstract

This project implements the classic bowling kata in Java with 100% test coverage.

The features of this project are a full implementation of the classic 10-pin bowling scoring system, an alternate 9-pin scoring system based on "uphill and downhill" variant and a console output for the bowling game

The biggest problems in the implementation were a well arranged console output and the implementation of the 10-pin bowling rules, because a thrown strike or spare has to wait for the results of the next throws, as they are included in the final calculation of the throw.
